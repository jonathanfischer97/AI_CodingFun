      "Membrane localization can generate nonlinear feedback by selectively accelerating reactions and assembly through enhancing the effective binding affinity of reactants on the membrane. This effect is explained by both a reduced diffusive search space in 2D vs 3D, as well as increased effective concentration with the same reactant copy numbers in the lower dimensional space. The effective binding enhancement has been mathematically modeled in recent work as a function of the volume to surface area ratio (V/A) of the system, which scales the forward kinetics of biomolecular reactions. According to their analysis using a physiological realistic range of cell V/A, bimolecular kinetics can be enhanced by multiple orders of magnitude compared to their counterparts in 3D diffusive space. Membrane localization is not a static binding enhancement, but rather is regulated by the activity of lipid-modifying enzymes, allowing for spatiotemporal control of specific membrane-protein affinities.Through simulation, weadditionally find that membrane localization alters the timescales of protein-protein assembly, but that the result is not dominated by changes in protein diffusion between solution and the membrane. Rather, for physiologic binding strengths, the rate-limiting step is the speed of binding to the membrane surface from solution.Membrane localization can affect biochemical kinetics through the volume to surface area ratio (V/A) of the cell. The membrane localization of species depends on the ratio of PIP2 to PIP, which is controlled by V/A. The rates of some species are the sum of both the 3D-2D reaction kinetics (kon * X * Y) as well as the same reaction with 2D-2D kinetics (Df * kon * X * Y), where the dimensional scaling factor Df = V/Ah. This factor weights the feedback strength for both the positive and negative feedback loops, where a higher Df translates to a larger rate enhancement for membrane-localized reactions.Membrane localization can isolate the role of membrane localization from other factors and provide a novel and valuable metric for interpreting how important membrane localization can be given the concentrations and binding properties of component proteins. It can be used as a quantitative guide for estimating how membrane heterogeneity, competition for binding, and mutations would influence the parameters of the model (volume, surface area, binding affinities and concentrations) and thus the proteins' subsequent response to localization. The theory represents a well-defined starting point from which to probe more complex systems and is a reference point for studying the time-dependence of assembly through computer simulation. Membrane localization can trigger protein assembly by pulling proteins to the membrane surface through protein or lipid binding.

       " 'source_documents': [Document(page_content='2006), there exists the potential for nonlinear feedback mechanisms between enzymatic activity and PIP metabolism(Haucke, 2005) that could drive oscillations.   Membrane localization like this can generate nonlinear feedback because it selectively accelerates reactions and assembly by enhancing the effective binding affinity of reactants on the membrane. This effect is explained by both a reduced diffusive search space in 2D vs 3D, as well as increased effective concentration with the same reactant copy numbers in the lower dimensional space. The effective binding enhancement has been mathematically modeled in recent work by Osman et al as a function of the volume to surface area ratio (V/A) of the system, which scales the forward kinetics of biomolecular reactions(Yogurtcu & Johnson, 2018). According to their analysis using a physiological realistic range of cell V/A, bimolecular kinetics can be enhanced by multiple orders of magnitude compared to their counterparts in 3D diffusive space. Membrane localization is not a static binding enhancement, but rather is regulated by the activity of the previously mentioned lipid-modifying enzymes. Through dynamically tuning the lipid composition, cells have spatiotemporal control of specific membrane-protein affinities to allow encoding of complex molecular logic and spatiotemporal memory in the lipid membrane. \\n Given the potential of a global variable like the membrane lipid composition to coordinate reaction dynamics, which is tunable by geometric rather than biochemical properties, we sought to build a minimal general model for a biochemical oscillator driven by membrane localization. Our inspiration and general reaction scheme was drawn from the PIP-mediated process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), where dynamically tuned membrane localization of endocytic machinery is necessary to control the expensive process of clathrin-coat assembly. In CME, the phosphorylated lipid PIP2 is effectively the “on” switch by which the cell signals rapid recruitment of the endocytic machinery for cargo uptake. This recruitment signal is conveyed via the adaptor protein AP2, which has multiple PIP2 specific lipid binding interfaces and protein binding interfaces to indirectly localize CME proteins to the membrane. Like other biological switches, a positive feedback loop exists to discretize concentrations into binary logic: the kinase PIP5K accelerates its own activity through increasing the amount of PIP2 anchors, and the', metadata={'source': '/Users/jonathanfischer/Desktop/AI_CodingFun/LangChainQueryTexts/ThesisPapers/MyDraft1.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

The model consists of five initial species: a lipid-modifying kinase (K), a lipid-modifying phosphatase (P), an adaptor protein (A), and two lipid species (PIP and PIP2). The lipid species are either bound to the membrane (M) or free in the cytosol ©. The adaptor protein binds to PIP2 on the membrane and recruits the kinase and the phosphatase. The kinase converts PIP to PIP2, while the phosphatase converts PIP2 to PIP. The membrane localization of the species depends on the ratio of PIP2 to PIP, which is controlled by the volume to surface area ratio (V/A) of the cell. The model exhibits oscillatory behavior due to the positive and negative feedback loops between the lipid composition and the enzymatic activity.  Our model primarily consists of a set of 12 coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In order to more rigorously test the oscillatory potential of the model, we initially make no Michaelis-Menten nor quasi-steady state approximations and leave the 12 dimensional system in its expanded form. Within this system, the rates of some species are the sum of both the 3D-2D reaction kinetics (kon * X * Y) as well as the same reaction with 2D-2D kinetics (Df * kon * X * Y), where the dimensional scaling factor Df = V/Ah. This factor weights the feedback strength for both the positive and negative feedback loops, where a higher Df translates to a larger rate enhancement for membrane-localized reactions.
