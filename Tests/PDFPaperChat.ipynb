By considering specific examples of oscillatory processes, we pick\\nout three general requirements for biochemical oscillations: delayed negative feedback, sufficient\\n‘nonlinearity’ of the reaction kinetics, and proper balancing of the time-scales of opposing\\nchemical reactions. Positive feedback is one mechanism to delay the negative feedback signal.\\nBiological oscillators can be classified according to the topology of the positive and negative\\nfeedback loops in the underlying regulatory mechanism.\\nBiochemical oscillations occur in many contexts (metabolism, signaling, development, etc.)\\nwhere they control important aspects of cell physiology, such as circadian rhythms, DNA\\nsynthesis and mitosis, and the development of somites in vertebrate embryos (see Table 1).\\nIn the 1950s and 60s, the first clear examples of biochemical oscillations (in metabolic\\nsystems) were recognized in glycolysis1, 2, in cyclic AMP production3, and the horseradish\\nperoxidase reaction4, 5. Soon after these discoveries, theoreticians were thinking about the\\ngeneral requirements for chemical oscillations and the specific mechanisms of these\\nexamples6, 7. After the molecular biology revolution of the 1980s, many new examples of\\noscillations in protein interaction networks and in gene regulatory networks came to light,\\nsuch as the PERIOD proteins in animal circadian control8, the CYCLIN proteins in\\neukaryotic cell cycle control9, 10, and the Repressilator11 in genetically engineered\\nbacteria.\\nUnderstanding the molecular basis of cellular oscillations is more than an exercise in\\nexperimental genetics and biochemistry. Oscillators have systems-level characteristics\\n(periodicity, robustness, entrainment) that transcend the properties of individual molecules\\nor reaction partners and involve the full topology of the reaction network. These properties\\ncan only be fully understood by viewing experimental data from a theoretical perspective,\\nby quantitative mathematical modeling of chemical oscillatory processes.

       " Document(page_content=\"In this review, we present a series of examples of increasing complexity, which illustrate the\\nfollowing essential requirements for biochemical oscillators. (1) Negative feedback is\\nnecessary to carry the reaction network back to the ‘starting point’ of its oscillation. (2) The\\nnegative feedback signal must be sufficiently delayed in time so that the chemical reactions\\ndo not home in on a stable steady state. (3) The kinetic rate laws of the reaction mechanism\\nmust be sufficiently ‘nonlinear’ to destabilize the steady state. (4) The reactions that produce\\nand consume the interacting chemical species must occur on appropriate time scales that\\npermit the network to generate oscillations. Time-delay can be created by a physical\\nconstraint (for example, the minimal time necessary to carry out transcription and\\ntranslation, or the time needed to transport chemical species between cellular\\ncompartments), by a long chain of reaction intermediates (as in a metabolic pathway), or by\\ndynamical hysteresis (overshoot and undershoot, as consequences of positive feedback in\\nthe reaction mechanism).\\nTo keep the mathematics of oscillating chemical reactions to a minimum, we will\\ndemonstrate the design principles of biochemical oscillators by rate plots (how do reaction\\nrates depend on chemical concentrations?), signal-response curves (how do oscillations turn\\non and off in response to regulatory signals?) and ‘constraint’ diagrams (how are the kinetic\\nconstants of the reaction mechanism constrained by requirements for periodicity?). The\\nmathematical details are made available to interested readers as online supplementary\\ninformation. For further details on the principles underlying chemical and biochemical\\noscillations, we refer the interested reader to books12-15 and review articles2, 6, 16-18.\\nNegative feedback with time delay\\nIn order to lay bare the ‘design principles’ of biochemical oscillators, it makes no sense to\\nstart with a fully detailed model of a particular cellular rhythm, such as the cell cycle in\\nhuman fibroblasts, which is likely to be so overlain by subtle control signals that the\\nessential features of the oscillator are obscure. Rather, we start from a highly idealized\\nmodel of periodic protein synthesis that illustrates the basic requirements of biochemical\\noscillators in their pristine form.\\nWe have in mind a protein (like PER in the circadian control system of fruit flies19, 20) that\\nrepresses the transcription of its own gene (Fig. 1a). The details of this feedback repression\\nare not important at present. The time-rate of change of protein concentration, d Y/dt, is\\ngiven by a simple kinetic equation,\\n(1)\\nwhere the first term is the rate of synthesis of protein and the second is its rate of\\ndegradation. The synthesis rate is proportional to a ‘signal’ S (which might be the\\nconcentration of a transcription factor that up-regulates the gene) multiplied by a factor,\\n, expressing how gene transcription is down-regulated by Y. In this factor, Kd\\nis the dissociation constant for binding of Y to the up-stream regulatory sequence of the\\ngene, and p is an integer indicating whether Y binds to the DNA sequence as a monomer,\\ndimer, trimer, etc. The rate constant k1 is the rate of synthesis of Y (per unit signal strength)\\nwhen the concentration of Y is small and the gene is fully expressed. In the second term, E\\nis a protease that degrades Y ( ET is the total concentration of enzyme); its turnover rate is k2\\nand its Michaelis constant is Km.

From the diagram it is clear that the protein concentration, if indeed it is\\ngoverned by the simple kinetic equation (1), will be drawn towards its steady-state value,\\nYo, without any oscillations, nor with any overshoots or undershoots. If ‘homeostasis’ is\\nwhat we desire, this is great, but if we are looking for ‘oscillations’ we need something\\nmore.\\nExplicit time delay\\nSuppose that the rate of protein synthesis at present (at time t) depends on the concentration\\nof protein at some time in the past (at time t-τ), where τ is the time delay required for\\ntranscription and translation. Then, the governing kinetic equation becomes\\n(2)\\nThis model of protein synthesis and degradation was first studied in detail by Mackey and\\nGlass in 197721. For a proper choice of rate constants and time delay, this equation exhibits\\nperiodic oscillations, as illustrated in Fig. 1c. The time delay causes the negative feedback\\ncontrol repeatedly to overshoot and undershoot the steady state (Fig. 1d). For details on how\\nto simulate Eq. (2) and all other models in this review, see supplementary information S1\\n(box).\\nBy ‘proper choice of rate constants…’ we mean that, in order for Y(t) to oscillate, the\\nkinetic parameters— S (signal strength), p (nonlinearity of feedback), Km (nonlinearity of the\\nremoval step), and τ (duration of time delay)—must satisfy specific constraints, illustrated\\nin Fig. 1e and f. For details on how these constraint curves are calculated, see supplementary\\ninformation S2 (box). The constraints can be summarized in three requirements. (1) The\\ntime delay, τ, must be sufficiently long. (For fixed values of p and Km, there is a minimum\\nvalue of τ —call it τmin—below which oscillations are impossible.) (2) The reaction rate\\nlaws must be sufficiently ‘nonlinear’. (Oscillations become easier—i.e., τmin gets smaller—\\nas either p or Kd/Km increases.)

       " Document(page_content=\"inequalities: τ / Tdegr > 2 and Tdegr / Tsyn > 1 (from the lowest curve in Fig. 1f). Estimating\\nthe time delay for transcription and translation to be about 20 min, we predict that, in order\\nfor the negative feedback loop to oscillate, the time scale for protein degradation must be <\\n10 min and the time scale for protein synthesis must be even shorter. If these conditions are\\nsatisfied, then the period of oscillation is (again, roughly speaking) between 2× and 4× the\\ntime delay, i.e., approximately 40—80 min.\\nIn the remainder of this review, we intend to show that these four requirements (negative\\nfeedback, nonlinearity, time delay, and time-scale constraints) are quite generally true of all\\nbiochemical oscillators, provided the notion of ‘time delay’ is suitably generalized.\\nTime delay by a series of intermediates\\nOur simple model of negative feedback on gene expression, Eq. (2), exhibits sustained\\noscillations if there is a sufficiently long time delay between the action of the protein Y on\\nthe gene and the appearance of new protein molecules in the cytoplasm. We expressed this\\nrequirement as a discrete time delay, τ, in the kinetic equation. Maybe we can dispense with\\nτ if we include the dynamics of mRNA in our model (Fig. 2a). To this end, we write a pair\\nof kinetic equations for X = [mRNA], Y = [Protein]:\\n(3)\\nIn Fig. 2b we plot the ‘nullclines’ of this pair of nonlinear differential equations. The X-\\nnullcline (curve a in Fig. 2b) is the locus of points in the ( X,Y) plane where the rate of\\nmRNA synthesis is exactly balanced by the rate of mRNA degradation, that is, where\\n. Along the X-nullcline, d X/dt = 0 and trajectories move horizontally in the\\n(X,Y) plane because there is no change in the X direction but there may be change in the Y\\ndirection. The Y-nullcline (curve b) is the locus of points where the rate of protein synthesis\\nis balanced by its rate of degradation, that is, where \\n . Along the Y-nullcline,\\ndY/dt = 0 and trajectories move vertically in the ( X,Y) plane. Where the nullclines intersect\\n(the solid circle in Fig. 2b), the trajectory comes to rest at a steady state (both d X/dt = 0 and\\ndY/dt = 0). The sample trajectories in Fig. 2b (the dashed lines) spiral into the stable steady\\nstate. Although the system of reactions may exhibit damped oscillations on the way to the\\nsteady state, sustained oscillations in this simple gene regulatory circuit are impossible22.\\nHence, adding mRNA to the model does not do away with the requirement for an explicit\\ntime delay.\\nBefore giving up the idea of replacing the time delay by a series of intermediates in the\\nnegative feedback loop, let's recognize that (in eukaryotes) the mRNA and protein molecules\\nneed to be transported between nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2c). Equation (3) is readily\\nexpanded to four variables: mRNA and protein in the nucleus ( Xn, Yn) and in the cytoplasm\\n(Xc, Yc). The four-variable negative feedback loop oscillates as naturally as a pendulum\\n(Fig. 2d)!\\nThe constraint diagrams in Fig. 2 underscore the conclusions of the previous section. Figure\\n2e shows that the kinetic rate laws must be sufficiently nonlinear ( p and/or Kd/Km large\\nenough).

Furthermore, if either kdxn → ∞ or kdyc → ∞, the negative feedback\\nloop reduces to three components, ( Xc, Yc, Yn) or ( Xn, Xc, Yn) respectively, and yet\\noscillations are still possible. Hence, we conclude that oscillations are impossible in a two-\\ncomponent negative feedback loop (Fig. 2b) but possible in a three-component negative\\nfeedback loop (Fig. 2f)22.\\nThis mechanism (negative feedback on gene expression with three or more components in\\nthe feedback loop), which we have used to illustrate the four basic principles of biochemical\\noscillations, was first put forward by Brian Goodwin23, 24 in mid-1960s as a model for\\nperiodic enzyme synthesis in bacteria. Our calculations in this section show that, with an\\neffective time delay (transcription + translation + reaction intermediates) of about 20 min,\\nthis model gives a period of about 1 h, which is close to the observed periods of such\\nrhythms25. This mechanism has also been a favorite model for circadian rhythms in flies\\nand mammals, governed by the PER protein, which moves into the nucleus and blocks\\nexpression of the PER gene26, 27. Of course, to get a period of 24 h, the time delay for the\\nfeedback signal must be considerably longer than the delay expected for transcription,\\ntranslation and nuclear transport. It is believed that PER undergoes slow post-translational\\nmodifications (phosphorylations) in the cytoplasm before it returns to the nucleus20.\\nThe possibility of sustained oscillations in a three-component negative feedback loop was\\nused by Elowitz and Leibler11 to design the ‘Repressilator’, a synthetic gene regulatory\\nnetwork in E. coli  consisting of three operons, each one expressing a protein that represses\\nthe next operon in the loop. The successful engineering of the Repressilator was a\\nfoundational triumph of the nascent field of ‘synthetic biology’ and a vindication of the\\ntheoretical ideas of Goodwin23, 24, Griffith22, Goldbeter26 and others.\\nTime delay by positive feedback\\nTime delay is a sort of memory: protein synthesis rate at the present time depends on protein\\nconcentration over some time in the past. Memory is a property of biochemical systems with\\nbistability: under identical chemical conditions, the system can be in either of two,\\nalternative, stable steady states28, 29. Which state the system is currently occupying\\ndepends on its recent history (a phenomenon called ‘hysteresis’). Hysteresis can prevent a\\nsystem with negative feedback from finding its homeostatic steady state. To see how this\\nhappens, we add positive feedback to our mRNA-protein example, Eq. (3). In particular, we\\nassume that protein Y, in addition to binding to its own gene regulatory site and down-\\nregulating its own expression, can bind to an allosteric site on protease E and inhibit E's\\nactivity (Fig. 3a). (Note: by inhibiting its own degradation, Y helps itself to accumulate.)\\nThe kinetic equations become:\\n(4)\\nIn these equations, kdy is the rate constant for an alternative pathway of protein degradation\\nand KI is a constant that characterizes the strength of the inhibition of enzyme E by its\\nsubstrate Y. In Eq. (4), as before, S is the concentration of a transcription factor that up-\\nregulates the expression of the mRNA encoding protein Y. We think of S as a signal that\\nmay induce sustained oscillations in protein level as a function of time.\\nIn Fig. 3b we draw the nullclines of Eqs. (4) in the same format as Fig. 2b. The effect of\\npositive feedback is to put a kink in the degradation curve (compare curves b in Figs. 2b and\\n3b), and the kink forces the dynamical system to overshoot and undershoot the steady stateNovak and Tyson Page 5\\nNat Rev Mol Cell Biol .

The system executes\\nsustained oscillations (Fig. 3c), provided the signal strength, S, is within certain bounds (Fig.\\n3d).\\nThe constraint diagrams (Figs. 3e and f) show that these oscillations require positive\\nfeedback (they disappear if KI is too small or too large) and proper balancing of time scales:\\nmRNA must be sufficiently stable ( kdx not too large) and signal strength must lie within\\nstrict bounds ( S not too large and not too small).\\nThis mechanism (negative feedback on gene expression + inhibition of protein degradation)\\nhas been suggested by Tyson et al.30 as a possible source of circadian rhythms in the\\nreaction network governing expression of the PER gene in fruit flies. Their idea was that\\nPER protein may form dimers that are less prone to degradation by the protease (‘E’ in the\\nmodel is casein kinase, which phosphorylates PER and labels it for proteolysis). Other\\nexamples of this design for oscillations will be given after we expand our notion of reaction\\nmechanisms from gene regulation to metabolic control systems and protein interaction\\nnetworks.\\nBiochemical interaction networks\\nUsing a simple gene regulatory network (GRN) as an example, we have discovered two\\ndistinct mechanisms for generating oscillations: a negative feedback loop with at least three\\ncomponents, and a combination of short positive and negative feedback loops. We might\\ndepict these mechanisms with the following ‘regulatory motifs’:\\nwhere X → Y means ‘X activates Y’ and X ⊣Y means ‘X inhibits Y’. The general ideas of\\nthe previous section—positive and negative feedback, time delay, nonlinearity—are not\\nlimited to GRNs but apply equally well to metabolic control systems (MCSs) and to protein\\ninteraction networks (PINs). We would like to know whether there is a general theory of\\nregulatory motifs (like the two above) that classifies types of biochemical oscillators.\\nIn this review, we are not so much interested in the precise mechanism of particular\\nbiochemical oscillators as in the patterns of activation and inactivation (that is, the\\nregulatory motifs) that appear repeatedly in all known oscillators. How ‘activation’ and\\n‘inhibition’ is actually carried out, biochemically, varies considerably, depending on the\\ncontext. In GRNs, transcription factors bind to regulatory sequences upstream of genes and\\ncontrol whether the gene is transcribed to mRNA or not. In MCSs, metabolites bind to\\nenzymes and control how quickly or slowly the enzyme catalyzes a particular chemical\\nreaction. In this way, metabolite X can ‘activate’ metabolite Y either by activating the\\nenzyme that produces Y or by inhibiting the enzyme that consumes Y. In PINs, protein X\\nmight activate protein Y because X is a kinase phosphorylating Y, or because X is a binding\\npartner forming an active XY dimer. Protein X might, just as well, inactivate protein Y by\\nbinding to Y or by phosphorylating Y, or because X is a protease that degrades Y. Given all\\nthese possibilities, there are myriad ways to build a PIN or MCS to instantiate a particular\\nregulatory motif. Our previous examples, involving negative feedback on gene expression,\\nsuggest that, besides the regulatory motif itself (the pattern of positive and negativeNovak and Tyson Page 6\\nNat Rev Mol Cell Biol .

       " Document(page_content='interactions), it is important that an oscillatory mechanism have sufficient ‘nonlinearity’ and\\nthat the rates of particular opposing reactions are properly balanced.\\nNonlinearities arise in biochemical reaction networks from many sources (Fig. 4). We have\\nalready used the example of a multimeric transcription factor binding to a genetic regulatory\\nsequence (Fig. 4a), for which the probability of binding is given by a nonlinear ‘Hill’\\nfunction31, \\n . Cooperative binding of substrates and modifiers to multi-subunit,\\nallosteric enzymes (Fig. 4b) also generates sigmoidal nonlinearities, adequately described by\\nHill functions or by more accurate kinetic rate laws31, 32. Reversible phosphorylation and\\ndephosphorylation of target molecules can create a sigmoidal signal-response curve, if the\\ninterconverting enzymes (kinase and phosphatase) have high affinity (low Km) for their\\nabundant substrates (zero-order ultrasensitivity33) or if the target molecule has multiple\\nphosphorylation sites (Fig. 4c)34. Our final example is a stoichiometric inhibitor that binds\\nto a regulatory protein (X) to form an inactive complex (Fig. 4d): as the total amount of X\\nincreases in response to signal (S), the active fraction of X shows a highly nonlinear signal-\\nresponse curve35. A high-affinity substrate can work as a stoichiometric inhibitor of its\\nenzyme, making enzyme activity for other substrates nonlinearly dependent on enzyme\\nlevel36. These sorts of interactions, when introduced into reaction networks of the right\\ntopology, may provide the nonlinearity needed to generate oscillations.\\nIn the next section we present a general classification scheme for simple regulatory motifs\\nthat exhibit sustained oscillations, provided the chemical implementation has sufficient\\nnonlinearity (introduced by reactions like those in Fig. 4) and the time scales of the reactions\\nare properly balanced.\\nClassification of oscillatory motifs\\nSo far, we have shown by examples that biochemical oscillations may be generated by a\\ndelayed negative feedback loop (at least three components in the loop) or by combining\\npositive and negative feedback loops. In this section, we want to put these two examples into\\na general scheme for classifying motifs of biochemical oscillators (Fig. 5).\\nFirst of all, we conjecture that oscillators always involve a negative feedback loop. We\\nknow of no examples of chemical oscillations without negative feedback, and negative\\nfeedback seems necessary to close a sequence of chemical states back on itself. In all our\\nexamples, we will use the letter X to denote the ‘activator’ and Y the ‘inhibitor’ in the\\nnegative feedback loop, that is, X ‘activates’ Y and Y ‘inhibits’ X. We allow that the\\nactivation or inhibition may be indirect, i.e., through an intermediate Z.\\nSecondly, we limit our study to mechanisms that lack autocatalysis (that is, cases where\\ncomponent X directly promotes its own activity). We can think of a few examples (a protein\\nkinase that phosphorylates and activates itself, or a misfolded protein that induces other\\ncopies of itself to misfold), but direct autocatalysis of this sort is rare compared to self-\\npromotion by a positive feedback loop (for example, X activates W and W activates X).\\nDirect autocatalysis can be incorporated into the scheme we are presenting, but it makes the\\nenumeration of cases unnecessarily complex.\\nWe have already shown that the capacity to oscillate (in networks lacking direct\\nautocatalysis) requires at least three chemical species interacting by at least three regulatory\\nlinks (activation or inhibition). Motifs (A) and (B) above show two simple examples: a\\nthree-component negative feedback loop, and a pair of coupled positive- and negative\\nfeedback loops (3 components and 4 links).

       " Document(page_content='topologically distinct motif for the capacity to oscillate. The oscillatory motifs we found can\\nbe divided into three classes, as follows.\\nClass 1: Delayed Negative Feedback Loops\\nBy delayed negative feedback we refer to 3 or more components connected in a single loop\\nby positive and negative links, with an odd number of inhibitory links. Delayed negative\\nfeedback is often used to model oscillatory responses in molecular cell biology. Besides\\ncircadian oscillations of PER protein in fruit flies (mentioned earlier), other examples\\ninclude oscillations of p53 in response to ionizing radiation (p53 → MDM2  mRNA →\\nMDM2 protein ⊣ p53)37-40 and oscillations of NF- κB in response to stimulation by tumor\\nnecrosis factor (NF- κB → IκB mRNA → IκB protein ⊣ NF-κB)40-43.\\nBecause this regulatory motif has 3 or more components, it cannot be adequately\\nrepresented by a two-variable state space, as in Figs. 2b and 3b. Nonetheless, it is instructive\\nto plot trajectories of the basic motif (X → Y → Z ⊣X) in the XY plane (Fig. 5a, left) and\\nin the XZ plane (Fig. 5a, right), and to compare these plots to the case of a two-component\\nnegative feedback loop (X → Y⊣X) in Fig. 2b. In that figure, curves a and b (called\\n‘nullclines’) indicate places where the flow of the reaction system is horizontal (in the Y\\ndirection only) and where it is vertical (in the X direction only). (Please notice that we\\nalways plot the activator X on the vertical axis.) These ‘flow indicators’ force the\\ntrajectories (the dashed curves in Fig. 2b) to spiral into the steady state. For the case of a\\ndelayed feedback loop, the trajectories do not obey the flow indicators (Fig. 5a). If we are\\nplotting X vs. Y (Fig. 5a, left panel), the limit cycle trajectory does not cross curve a in a\\nhorizontal direction, because the rate of synthesis of X depends on Y concentration some\\ntime in the past. If we are plotting X vs. Z (Fig. 5a, right panel), the limit cycle trajectory\\ndoes not cross curve b in a vertical direction, because the rate of synthesis of Z depends on\\nX concentration some time in the past. In either case, the delay allows the trajectory to form\\na closed orbit around the steady state instead of spiraling into it.\\nClass 2: Amplified Negative Feedback Loops\\nIn Fig. 3 we considered a special case where the inhibitor (the protein) is amplified by a\\npositive feedback loop. It should be obvious that activator amplification may be just as\\neffective. For the case of activator amplification (Fig. 5b, left panel), the X-nullcline (curve\\na) is ‘kinked’ by the positive feedback loop. For inhibitor amplification (Fig. 5b, right\\npanel), the Y-nullcline (curve b) is ‘kinked’. In either case, trajectories are now forced to\\nwheel around the steady state onto a closed orbit (curve c, a sustained oscillation).\\nWhere do the ‘kinks’ come from? A two-component positive feedback loop (W → X → W\\nor W ⊣X ⊣W) can respond in a bistable manner to inhibition by Y. (In this case—Fig. 5b,\\nleft—we are thinking of Y as signal strength and X as the response variable.) If Y is large,\\nthen X will be small, for sure, and if Y is small, then X may be large. But for intermediate\\nvalues of Y, the steady state concentration of X can be either large or small, depending upon\\nhow the system got to the intermediate value of Y. This bistability is reflected in the Z-\\nshaped nullcline (curve a) on the left of Fig. 5b. For the case of inhibitor amplification (Fig.\\n5b, right), we think of X as signal strength and Y as response variable. In this case, Y can be\\na multi-valued function of X, and the Y-nullcline (curve b) becomes N-shaped. In either\\ncase, the negative feedback between X and Y forces trajectories to rotate clockwise on our\\nstandard XY plane, and the positive feedback loop puts kinks in one of the nullclines to\\nprevent trajectories from spiraling into the steady state.\\nThis class of oscillators appears commonly in the literature, from the earliest models of', metadata={'source': '/Users/jonathanfischer/Desktop/AI_CodingFun/LangChainQueryTexts/ThesisPapers/DesignPrinciplesOscillators.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

An inhibitor-amplified negative feedback loop\\n(X=Cdc10, Y=Cig2, Z=Rum1) has been used by Novak & Tyson49 to model\\nendoreplication (periodic DNA synthesis in the absence of cell division) in mutant fission\\nyeast cells. Recently, a synthetic oscillator based on an activator-amplified negative\\nfeedback loop has been built in bacteria by Jeff Hasty's group50.\\nClass 3: Incoherently Amplified Negative Feedback Loops\\nBy rewiring an activator-amplified negative feedback loop (D), we create new regulatory\\nmotifs (C and E)\\nthat may also have the potential to oscillate. Each of the motifs (C) and (E) has a two-\\ncomponent positive feedback loop (− −, in both C and E) embedded in a three-component\\nnegative feedback loop (+ + − in C and − − − in E). Motif (C) also has the characteristic that\\nX inhibits W directly and activates W indirectly (through Y). This characteristic is called an\\nincoherent feedforward loop (C ′). Motif (E) can also be redrawn as an incoherent\\nfeedforward loop (E ′).\\nHence, we describe these motifs as incoherently amplified negative feedback loops (NFLs).\\nIn both motifs C ′ and E′, the embedded positive feedback loop is (− −). There are two other\\nincoherently amplified NFLs based on an embedded (+ +) feedback loop. The four cases are\\nshown in Fig. 5c. In each case, the NFL may, of course, oscillate in its own right, but the\\nadditional positive feedback loop adds bistability and robustness to the mechanism51.\\nThe earliest models of glycolytic oscillations 52-54 belong to this class of oscillators (Fig.\\n5c, fourth motif). In this motif, Z → X refers to the biochemical reaction that converts\\nfructose-6-phosphate + ATP (Z) into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate + ADP (X). The enzyme\\nthat catalyzes this reaction, phosphofructokinase (species Y in the motif), is activated by\\nADP (X → Y), and the active form of Y promotes both the removal of Z (Y ⊣ Z) and the\\nproduction of X (Y → X).\\nThe Martiel-Goldbeter55 model of cyclic AMP oscillations in slime mold cells is another\\nexample of the fourth motif in Fig. 5c. In this case, intracellular cAMP is the activator (X)\\nand extracellular cAMP is the incoherent signaler (Y). Extracellular cAMP binds to a\\nmembrane receptor that quickly activates the enzyme that synthesizes cAMP from ATP\\ninside the cell. This is the fast activatory signal from Y to X. Furthermore, extracellular\\ncAMP pushes the membrane receptor (Z) into an inactive state, which only slowly recovers\\nactivity after cAMP is destroyed by extracellular phosphodiesterase. This is the slow\\ninhibitory signal from Y to X. Tyson & Novak56, 57 use incoherently amplified(- -)NFLsNovak and Tyson Page 9\\nNat Rev Mol Cell Biol .

To model oscillations in p53 (a transcription factor that coordinates\\nintracellular responses to DNA damage), Ciliberto et al.58 used an incoherently amplified(−\\n−)NFL and Zhang et al.59 suggested an alternative mechanism based on an incoherently\\namplified(+ +)NFL (the first model in their Fig. 1).\\nOther possibilities?\\nThere are three other regulatory motifs with 3 components, 4 links and a topology similar to\\nmotifs (C ′) and (E′):\\nIn these motifs, we use circles to indicate interactions of either sign (+ or -); two white\\ncircles must have the same sign, whereas black and white circles have opposite signs.\\nMotif (F) is a ‘coherently repressed’ NFL, consisting of two negative feedback loops, one\\nwith three components and the other with two components. Clearly, if the link X → Y is\\nweak enough, the three-component NFL might oscillate on its own. Addition of the two-\\ncomponent NFL dampens the propensity of the three-component NFL to oscillate.\\nMotif (G) is a different sort of incoherently amplified NFL; it differs from the Class 3 motifs\\nin Fig. 5c in that the positive loop has three components (rather than two) and the negative\\nloop has two components (rather than three). Everything we have said so far might lead us to\\nexpect oscillations in this motif under the right choice of nonlinearities and rate constants.\\nHowever, it is possible to show that motif (G) cannot generate oscillations for any choice of\\nnonlinear rate equations or any parameter settings (see supplementary information S3\\n(box)).\\nMotif (H) has two positive feedback loops, one with two components and one with three.\\nWe might expect this regulatory motif to exhibit bistability but not oscillations, and indeed\\nthis is the case (see supplementary information S4 (box)).\\nMore complex topologies and oscillatory behaviours\\nTo this point we have exhausted all possible oscillatory motifs with 3 components and at\\nmost 4 links. Topologies with 3 components and 5 or 6 links are so densely connected that it\\nis difficult to think of them as regulatory ‘motifs’. For example, motif (I) combines a Class 2\\ninhibitor-amplified negative feedback loop with a Class 1 three-component negative\\nfeedback loop. Either sub-motif may oscillate in its own right. Motif (I) has recently been\\nused by Rust et al.60 to model circadian oscillations in phosphorylation state of the KaiC\\nprotein in cyanobacteria.

       " Document(page_content=\"Allowing for four components and 5 or 6 links opens new possibilities that we have not\\nexplored systematically. Some oscillatory motifs are simple generalizations of topologies we\\nhave seen before. For example, motif (J) is just an activator-amplified negative feedback\\nloop (Class 2); the only difference from Fig. 5b is that the negative feedback loop has been\\nextended to three components. This motif is capable of oscillating61.\\nBy combining two or more oscillatory motifs in a common mechanism it is possible to\\ncreate quite exotic behavior including chaos, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Figure 6a, adapted from\\nRössler's classic paper62. on chemical chaos, presents two overlapping ‘activator\\namplification’ oscillators (W-X-Y 1 and W-X-Y 2) that share a common activator. As Fig. 6b\\nshows, the time course of X fluctuates up and down but never repeats itself. Viewing a\\ntrajectory in (X-Y 1-Y2) space (Fig. 6c), we see that the curve never closes on itself (it is not\\nperiodic) and seems to sweep out a surface of complex topology.\\nIt would be beyond the scope of this review to go further into the subtleties of deterministic\\nchaos, except to point out that the requirements for chaos seem to be quite undemanding.\\nChaotic trajectories readily arise in systems of coupled oscillators. Since multiple, coupled\\noscillators are likely to be common companions in the complex reaction networks\\nunderlying cell physiology, it is surprising that deterministic chaos has not been identified\\nmore often in experimental data5. Perhaps the chaotic trajectories of individual cells are\\naveraged out when large populations of cells are monitored. When the behavior of single\\ncells is monitored with fluorescent proteins, the possibility of deterministic chaos is likely to\\nbe swamped by the white noise of molecular fluctuations in small volumes (a single cell).\\nNonetheless, experimentalists and theoreticians should be open to the possibility of\\ndeterministic chaos in their data and models of complex reaction networks with multiple\\nsources of oscillation.\\nSumming up\\nBy modelling specific examples of oscillatory processes, we have drawn a number of\\ngeneral conclusions about the design principles of biochemical oscillators. All biochemical\\noscillators are built around some sort of negative feedback signal (X → Y → … ⊣X),\\nwhich insures that, if the concentration of X gets too large, it will eventually decrease, and if\\nit gets too small it will eventually increase 63. Negative feedback is often used in\\nbiochemistry to achieve homeostasis (a stable steady state of intermediate X level), but\\nunder certain conditions the steady state may lose stability and be replaced by spontaneous\\noscillations of X level (high → low → high → low → …). The conditions for oscillations\\nare: sufficient nonlinearity in the reaction kinetics, sufficient ‘memory’ in the negative\\nfeedback loop, and proper balancing of the time scales of components within the loop. In\\nbiochemical reaction kinetics there are many sources of nonlinearity that are conducive to\\noscillations (Fig. 4). ‘Memory’ may be a simple consequence of a long negative feedback\\nloop, but more likely it stems from positive feedback loops in the biochemical reaction\\nmechanism. When positive feedback creates two, alternative, stable steady states in the\\nreaction dynamics, then the system can ‘remember’ its recent history and thereby overshoot\\nand undershoot the homeostatic tendencies of the negative feedback loop.Novak and Tyson Page 11\\nNat Rev Mol Cell Biol .

       " Document(page_content='With these ideas in mind we classify biochemical oscillators according to the topology of\\nthe positive and negative feedback loops in the reaction mechanism. For systems with three\\ncomponents and three-or-four links (no self-activation links), we identify three classes of\\noscillators: delayed negative feedback loops, amplified negative feedback loops, and\\nincoherently amplified negative feedback loops. Our classification scheme is by no means\\ncomplete, and oscillator motifs may be more complicated than any of our classes. Also, we\\nhave neglected mixed-mode effects, e.g., Y activates the synthesis of X at low concentration\\nand inactivates it at high concentration. Mixed-mode interactions may easily generate\\ncomplex oscillations and chaos.\\nIf a reaction mechanism contains one of the regulatory motifs we have identified, then it\\nmay exhibit oscillatory behavior, provided the rate constants are properly tuned. Because\\ninteraction motifs and reaction rate constants are under genetic control, it is possible for\\nbiochemical oscillators to evolve. Indeed, it is likely that biochemical oscillations have\\narisen repeatedly from basic, homeostatic, negative feedback loops by serendipitous genetic\\nchanges that destabilized the steady state and generated sustained oscillations. Maladaptive\\noscillations would have been quickly weeded out by selection, but weakly deleterious or\\nadventitious oscillations may have been co-opted by evolving populations for beneficial\\nphysiological purposes. Almost surely, mechanisms of circadian rhythms evolved many\\ntimes independently by this scenario. On the other hand, bistability and oscillations that\\ngovern cell cycle events are much more highly constrained, and the underlying mechanism\\n(which seems to be universal across all eukaryotic cells) must have been derived from a\\nsingle common ancestor.\\nAnother consequence of the fact that a given interaction motif may or may not oscillate,\\ndepending on subtle balancing of reaction rates, is the possibility of a class of ‘dynamical\\ndiseases’ as distinct from ‘genetic diseases’. In a genetic disease, like sickle cell anemia, a\\nmutant gene encodes a defective protein that cannot do its essential job in some important\\naspect of physiology. In a dynamical disease, a mutant gene encodes a modified protein that\\nstill does its job but at a different rate, thereby causing a homeostatic control mechanism to\\nbreak out into pathological oscillations, or an oscillatory control system to spiral into a\\nstable steady state. Some cyclic blood disorders may be dynamical diseases of the first kind,\\nand some sleep disorders may be dynamical diseases of the second kind.\\nFinally, we hope that this review will help biochemists and molecular biologists to\\nunderstand better the mechanisms underlying cellular oscillations and to recognize the\\nimportance of quantitative modelling in studying these oscillations.\\nSupplementary Material\\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\\nAcknowledgments\\nJJT acknowledges financial support from the National Institutes of Health (R01-GM07898 and R01-GM079207)\\nand the hospitality of Merton College, Oxford, during the writing of this review.

       "'The design principles of biochemical oscillators can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n1. Negative feedback: This is necessary to bring the reaction network back to the starting point of its oscillation. The negative feedback signal ensures that if a concentration of a component gets too large, it will eventually decrease, and if it gets too small, it will eventually increase.\\n\\n2. Time delay: The negative feedback signal must be sufficiently delayed in time so that the chemical reactions do not home in on a stable steady state. Time-delay can be created by a physical constraint, a long chain of reaction intermediates, or by dynamical hysteresis (overshoot and undershoot) as consequences of positive feedback in the reaction mechanism.\\n\\n3. Nonlinearity: The kinetic rate laws of the reaction mechanism must be sufficiently nonlinear to destabilize the steady state. In biochemical reaction kinetics, there are many sources of nonlinearity that are conducive to oscillations.\\n\\n4. Proper balancing of time scales: The reactions that produce and consume the interacting chemical species must occur on appropriate time scales that permit the network to generate oscillations. This balance ensures that the system can maintain its oscillatory behavior.\\n\\nThese design principles are derived from studying specific examples of oscillatory processes and help in understanding the mechanisms underlying cellular oscillations.'"
